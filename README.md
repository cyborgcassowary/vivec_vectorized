# Vectorizing Vivec
My attempt to vectorize a landscape from Elder Scrolls Morrowind. The Sound and Graphics Overhaul Mod has been installed for this version of Morrowind (giving it a Skyrim feel to it... I still haven't played Oblivion). Here's the scene I'm vectorizing:

<figure title="The City of Vivec"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyborgcassowary/vivec_vectorized/master/vivec_morrowind.png" alt="Viewing the Arena from Redoran" style="width:auto; display:block;"></figure>    

And here's is where I'm currently at:

<figure title="A vector sketched version of Vivec"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyborgcassowary/vivec_vectorized/master/vivec_morrowind_sketch.png" alt="A vector sketch version of Vivec viewing the Arena to Redoran" style="width:auto; display:block;"></figure>    

## Why show this on github?

I'm hoping graphic designers could give input to what I can do and where I can take this project. Any advice would be appreciated.
